During Autumn 2017, I did an internship with Beatriz Arroyo, François Mougeot, and Miguel Delibes-Mateos at IREC (CSIC - UCLM) in Ciudad Real, Spain.  

We used Q-methodology, a quali-quantitative social science, to describe shared viewpoints about Common vole (_Microtus arvalis_) outbreak in Northern Spain. During this project, I conducted social interviews with farmers, hunters, conservationists, and members of the local government to idenitfy groups of shared opinions about this intense conservation conflict.
