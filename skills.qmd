## **CURRENT PROJECTS**

During my *Juan de la Cierva* postdoctoral position, I mainly investigate two main research questions:

  * Understanding stakeholders perceptions of wildlife adaptive management.
  * Studying the role of statistical models in the construction of reliable ecological knowledge.

Meanwhile, I also participate in side-projects, for example:

  * Investigating short-eared owl (*Asio flammeus*) migratory behaviour, work with [François Mougeot](https://www.irec.es/en/personal/detalle/mougeot-francois/).
  * Investigating hunter’s preferences for the management of the Egyptian mongoose expansion in Spain.

  
## **PAST PROJECTS**

  * As a previous postdoc at the [CEFE](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) in Montpellier, I worked with [Aurélien Besnard](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/actus/44-french/recherche/bc/bev/291-aurelien-besnard) as a member of [Human-Animal Interaction group](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/). I was onboard the [Migralion project](https://www.france-energies-marines.org/en/projects/migralion/) with France Energies Marines, an ambituous research program funded by the [French Biodiversity Office](https://ofb.gouv.fr/en) aiming at studying birds migration in the Gulf of Lion (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea). I was in charge of developing integrated models combining telemetry, counts, and radar data.
  * Understanding the role of ecological monitoring in the functioning of Marine Protected Areas of the French Mediterranean Sea (more details [here](dolphin.qmd))
  * Developing integrated models to combine distance sampling and Spatial-Capture Recapture data from bottlenose dolphin (*Tursiops truncatus*).
  * Understanding conservation conflicts associated with rodent outbreaks in farmland areas (more [here](rodent.qmd)).
  * Mapping wolf recolonization in France accounting for species misidentification and including uncertain data (more details [here](wolf.qmd)).

## **TEACHING EXPERIENCE**

  * Around 200h of teaching in ecology, statistics, and wildlife management at the University of Montpellier, France.
  * Workshop about Introduction to Bayesian statistics for ecologists in IREC-CSIC, Spain.
